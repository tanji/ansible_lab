CeleraOne Application-Task for System Operations
================================================

Let's assume we have 3 centOS 6 VMs:
Test1 - 192.168.30.1
Test2 - 192.168.30.2
Test3 - 192.168.30.3

Using any configuration management tool (preference given to using Ansible) configure each host as the following:

Host Test1:
- Haproxy installed and running on port 80
- Load balances requests to Test2 and Test3 port 8000
- Failover for hosts Test2 and Test3 should be setup for port 8000 (use sensible upstream checks)

Host Test2 and Host Test3:
- Nginx is installed and running on port 8000
- The file "/var/www/local.html" exists and contains the hostname of each machine
- Nginx location rules as following:
    - "/probe_local" should show the contents of /var/www/local.html
    - "/probe_applicant" should return your availability for being 24/7 on-call at CeleraOne (shared with other team members)
    - "/*" forwarded to your favorite website
    - "/probe_remote" forwarded to localhost:5500

In addition please make sure:
- Production settings should be reflected in the haproxy, nginx, sysctl, etc. settings
- Please take the number of CPUs on the local machine into account for the nginx settings
- All hosts are reboot safe
- Documentation is in place where applicable

Please archive and send back the playbook/cookbook/manifest/configs etc. via mail.
